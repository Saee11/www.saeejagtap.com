    <h4 class="text-capitalize"> <kbd> Dubai </kbd></h4>
<hr> 
    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" > 30 JUNE 2021</h5>
    
    <p class="text-left text-muted"> Beautiful, shiny skyscrapers, state of the art buildings and beautiful beaches and sand dunes; fine dining; fabulous all-inclusive accommodation options, shopping at Dubai Mall and adrenaline filled experiences all make Dubai a fantastic tourist destination.Dubai certainly dazzles with its uber-modern design showcased in sights like the Burj Al Arab, and with its over-the-top attractions like the Dubai Mall and Palm Jumeirah. But it wasn't the glitzy nightclubs and crowd-pleasing brunches that won me over, it was the traditional architecture, Emirati culture, and delicious pistachio dates. So if you're looking for a more traditional slice of life, here are some of my favorite places you should visit in Dubai.

    <h4 class="text-capitalize"> <kbd> Singapore </kbd></h4>
<hr> 
    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" > 5TH DECEMBER 2018</h5>
    
    <p class="text-left text-muted"> What a fantastic place to visit, this must be the place to go if you want to see a society where respect still exists. Singapore is one of the cleanest and safest countries we have ever visited, the MRT (underground) is not only a very efficient and cheap way of seeing Singapore City, it is a pleasure to be able to move about in a foreign city without fear of crime. Their is plenty to do and see with Raffles Hotel for afternoon tea, Boat Quay for eveing meals on the waterside, night time safari at the zoo and not forgetting a visit to San Tosa Island where you can relax on the beach or view the magnificent Lion with a superb view back over Singapore Island. You can visit San Tosa by Cable Car or monorail, both ways being extemely good value. For electronics buffs Sim City has five floors of Cameras, electronics and computer equipment (this one centre can take a half day to see it all). Food is available everywhere from street vendors to good resturants (one revolves through 360 degrees whislt eating your meal to give a panoramic of this great city). The architecture is magnificant from the very old to the ultra modern, both sitting side by side and a photographers dream.

    <h4 class="text-capitalize"> <kbd> New York</kbd></h4>
<hr> 
    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" > APRIL 2019</h5>
    
    <p class="text-left text-muted"> The city of dreams is a wonderful place. I recommend everyone visit at least once in their lifetime. There are great opportunities, restaurants, and relationships awaiting everyone.Great place to meet new people. Access to everything! I love living in New York City. I like using the train to get anywhere in all five boroughs.I love the food and the overall environment. I do strongly wish that rent was lower, but other than that, it's great. The people are friendly and helpful and again, the food is good and there are many jobs, stores, libraries, and places to spend your time in.
There is an unbelievable amount to do in NYC. It is quite literally a city that never sleeps. With its iconic places like Union Square, Times Square, and Bryant Park, there is never a dull moment.

            <p> The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.

The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear. </p>

            <p> I haven’t had the fortune of watching the 1994 original The Lion King or the 2012 3D re-release in theaters, but I still remember watching the it on Television after it was digitally re-mastered. From then on, it has been on my top favourite list. I have watched the movie again and again and still cherish the experience.

            <p> HOLY!  WOW!  WHAT AN ADVENTURE!  I loved how the story focused on bringing others together then blowing things up.  I loved how the story was set in Autumn.  Autumn is the season that most people aren’t interested in.  When people watch this movie people will realize that Autumn is festive if we just see it from a different perspective.  I also loved how the native people who lived in the forest rely upon and trust nature.  That is the way we are supposed to view nature.  This movie is connecting to the four great natural resources that we use on our planet - Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.  That is so environmentalist!  Without these resources, we wouldn't exist!  My favorite characters are Elsa and Anna.  I really loved Elsa and Anna's character because these girls are worthy of taking risks on their own just like men do.  Also, their mother had these two daughters for a very important reason.  Elsa performed by Idina Menzel is the perfect mythic and larger than life character.  Grateful her kingdom now accepts her, she works hard to be a good queen..</p>

While prior to the death of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru Children’s day was celebrated on 20 November, after his death a resolution was passed to commemorate his birth anniversary as Children’s day.

The Bal Shakti Award was launched in 1996 as the National Child Award for Exceptional Achievement. In 2018, the awards were recognised as Bal Shakti Puraskar. It is given to children for extraordinary accomplishments in innovation, scholastic achievements, social service, arts and culture, sports and bravery. Any child who is an Indian citizen and is between the age of 5-18 years is eligible for the award.

After being selected from the hot seat by the show’s host Amitabh Bachchan, the 25-year-old went on to answer a series of questions.

After giving the wrong answer to a question worth Rs 7 crore, Himani exited the game but with a Rs 1 crore cash prize. At the end of the episode, she expressed her immense gratitude towards the host and explained how she hopes to use the money to open a special coaching centre to teach divyang (disabled) students.

She said, “A lot of students with disabilities get selected into various schools and colleges. But there is no designated coaching centre or teachers to help them prepare for competitive examinations.”
